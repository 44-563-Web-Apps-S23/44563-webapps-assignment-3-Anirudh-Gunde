        <h2>Cricket</h2>
        <p>I like it because of the intelligent moves it has.And the moments in the end of the match will be more engrossing. T20 league's every ball will be a edge of the seat experience.I excite to watch <strong>MS Dhoni</strong>,<strong>Virat Kohli.</strong>
           <b>It requires both individual skill and nerve, as well as selfless teamwork.</b> It calls for both short-term and long-term tactics. A good cricket match contains a combination of courage, daring, patience, aggression, flair, imagination, expertise, and fierce defiance that is unrivaled in other, more superficial sports.</p>
