        <h2>Cricket</h2>
        <p>I like it because of the intelligent moves it has.And the moments in the end of the match will be more engrossing. T20 league's every ball will be a edge of the seat experience.I excite to watch <strong>MS Dhoni</strong>,<strong>Virat Kohli.</strong>
           <b>It requires both individual skill and nerve stimulating moves and selfless teamwork</b> There should be both short-term and long-term tactics. A good cricket team must contain a combination of courage, imagination, daring, aggression, expertise, patience,flair and fierce.</p>
